# Project

The project is a simple word game in which the player is given a random set of letters to construct a word with. When the player constructs a word that is found in the database, they will receive score equal to the length of the word ^ 2, and new letters will be arranged. There will be 10 letters given, and the player can press reroll button to gain new letters with progressively increasing penalty.

The player has 1 minute to come up with as many words as is possible, after which the game ends and the player can input their name and score into the highscores which will be displayed to other players. There needs to be basic security measures to prevent injections and other shady business from potentially malicious players.
